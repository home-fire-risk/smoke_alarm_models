## Target variable 2a: # of incidents per 1000 people within a region

- [github issue](https://github.com/home-fire-risk/smoke_alarm_models/issues/22)
- [model document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJN-QwLVqFHOvrRNtW2KEAkNZ-PuFiqTwa8y3iXx1Sg/edit)

2) Which areas are in most danger of having fires
Measure 1
- indicator: # of incidents per 1000 people within a region
- challenge: how to deal with regions where fire departments don’t report data
- inherent bias in coverage of NFIRS (ok for now).
- use state coverage to show confidence in estimates from NFIRS
- data source: NFIRS

By region we are refering census tract now. 
For each tract, calculate
- all structured fire incidents, this is the best approximate we can get for home fires.
- normalize fire incidents counts by tract population. Tracts with zero or less than 100 population were ignored, which could create unproportionate value. These places could be parks with small population and many fire incidents, but the inherent fire risk for each home are not necessarily significantly larger than other places.

Data file loaded for disk(for every year in 2009 ~ 2013):
2013_formated_addresses.Rdata   NFIRS incident address formated. Project google drive folder have csv version.
2013_geocoded_addresses.Rdata   NFIRS incident address geocoded. Project google drive folder have csv version.
2013_basicincident.rds          NFIRS original data, loaded as R data.table, saved as R object.
2013_fireincident.rds           NFIRS original data, loaded as R data.table, saved as R object.
